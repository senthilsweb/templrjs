The architecture and design of `zytes` is based on time-tested `database driven design` coupled with modern front-end stacks that can be deployed cross platform in a hybrid infrastructure i.e. cloud and or on-prem in a serverless model without using any `Virtual Machines` or `AWS Lambda` or `Azure Function` by leveraging `Chrome V8` runtimes a.k.a `Javascript Isolate` or `Ilands Architecture`. The programming language is `Javascript (EC6)`, the most widely used language in the universe.

The popular V8 runtime that `zytes` can be deployed on the edge nodes are:

- [Denos](https://deno.land/)
- [Netlify edge functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/#netlify-edge-functions)
- [Vercel functions](https://vercel.com/)
- [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)

Edge computing are best suited for static websites as the supported protocols between the client browser and the server is `HTTP(s)`, inorder to build and deploy database driven applications on the edge, you need `Data proxy` which sits inbetween the client browser and the database. The `Supabase` cloud acts as `Data Proxy` by offering out of the box *REST* and *GraphQL* APIs for the following database objects:

- Tables
- Viewes
