<a class="dark:text-teal-400 relative transition hover:text-teal-500 dark:hover:text-teal-400"  href = "https://senthilsweb.wordpress.com/2018/09/18/az-tech-radiology-how-we-built-our-cloud-based-physician-portal-web-mobile-and-hl7-interface-engine-01/www.aztechradiology.com">AZ-Tech Radiology</a> is one of the leading medical imaging organization that provides the highest quality imaging services utilizing state-of-the-art equipment and technologies in Arizona.  Our primary goal is “Keeping the referring physician happy”, all roads lead to the ease of delivery of “radiology reports” to them and their sending of orders to the lab”

In order to meet the goal, we have to have state of the art technological solution which drove us to build the new cloud based connected IT systems:

::list{type="success"}
1. Radiology Information System
2. HL7 Interface Engine which connects all of our modalities, external EMR and Insurance companies, pushing data to the cloud in a secure manner.
3. Promotional Website @ [https://www.aztechradiology.com](https://www.aztechradiology.com)
4. Physician Portal to delivering the reports @ [https://provider.aztechradiology.com/](https://provider.aztechradiology.com/)
5. Physician mobile app @ [https://m.provider.aztechradiology.com/](https://m.provider.aztechradiology.com/)
::

In this blog post I would like to share the Architecture we came up with which powers our IT systems.

## HL7 Interface of our Modalities (Imaging equipment) with RIS

## End result

After we implemented the solutions in phased manner starting from Jan 2018 uptil now, following are the benefits we gained

::list{type="success"}
1. Average speed of our report delivery time reduced from **days** to **minutes**
2. Cost of the delivery of reports reduced multi-fold otherwise we enagened half a dozen employees faxing the reports to the physician office manually
3. We can deliver the reports to physican hands thru our mobile solution
4. We automated the sending of Fax (reports) to the clinics who still needs paper copy of the reports
5. Customer satisfaction thru enhanced user experience in the form of simple to use web and mobile application
