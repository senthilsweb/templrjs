![TemplrJS Framework Architecture](/i/blog/templrjs-architecture.png)

[TemplrJS](https://github.com/senthilsweb/templrjs)  is an Open Source Developer tooling platform I developed, leveraging the capabilities of Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, and DuckDB/MotherDuck. It's crafted to provide developers with a seamless and efficient experience for creating fast, performance-optimized web and mobile sites, apps, and data-driven dashboards.

I initiated TemplrJS Project to power my own blog site [www.senthilsweb.com](www.senthilsweb.com) and made the leap to open source in July, 2021 under the code named **zypress**. TemplrJS began as a vision 3 years ago and has since undergone substantial refinement.

The architecture is based on time-tested database driven design coupled with modern front-end stacks that can be deployed cross platform in a hybrid infrastructure i.e. cloud and or on-prem in a serverless model without using any Virtual Machines or AWS Lambda or Azure Function by leveraging Chrome V8 runtimes a.k.a Javascript Isolate or Ilands Architecture. The programming language is Javascript (EC6), the most widely used language in the universe.
