## Introduction
In today’s data-driven environment, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generative AI and text processing is not just important but increasingly common. With tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai/), Perplexity and open-source AI models like Llama, [Mistral.ai](http://mistral.ai/) etc. people now rely on LLMs for tasks ranging from email proofreading to refining documents like legal contracts and research papers. However, this widespread adoption also brings a critical challenge: **How do we protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) within these workflows?**

Privacy Shield is an open-source utility I created to address the increasing need for protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) when working with Large Language Models (LLMs). It builds directly on the code developed by [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/guides/productionization/safety/presidio_data_anonymization/reversible/) and Microsoft Presidio, which has been ported as a Python API and designed to be consumed as an API or microservice by frontend applications. It provides a structured approach to anonymize sensitive data, enhance text, and enable reversible de-anonymization, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure throughout the processing workflow.

In this article, I explore the core technology, implementation details, and benefits of incorporating Privacy Shield into workflows that handle sensitive data, along with practical guidance and real-world examples.

## Use Case Scenario: Protecting Sensitive Data
Consider a scenario where a company is processing legal documents or customer logs that contain PII. The goal is to use LLMs to refine the text, improve clarity, or extract insights. However, directly exposing sensitive data to external services poses a privacy risk.

With **Privacy Shield**, the organization can:

::list{type="success"}
- Replace PII with realistic synthetic data.
- Use LLMs to enhance text.
- Restore the original PII after processing.
::

This ensures compliance with privacy regulations and eliminates the risk of data leaks.

## Ingredients / Technology Stack
Privacy Shield combines several modern technologies to deliver a seamless and secure text-processing workflow:

::list{type="success"}
- **[Presidio](https://ollama.com/):** An open-source library for **detecting and anonymizing PII**, supporting over 100 PII types.
- **[LangChain](https://ollama.com/):** A framework for building **LLM-powered applications**, used here for reversible anonymization and LLM integration.
- **[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) or [Ollama API](https://ollama.com/):** Provides access to powerful **LLMs like GPT-3.5-turbo or Llama3.2** for text processing.
- **Python:** The core programming language for the project's **backend logic and component integration.**
- **[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/):** A high-performance web framework for building the **REST API.**
::

## Technical Design / Schematic Flow

## Benefits of Privacy Shield

::list{type="success"}
- **PII Protection:** Keeps sensitive information secure by never exposing it to external services.
- **Data Privacy:** Uses robust anonymization and de-anonymization techniques.
- **Safe Processing:** Allows for powerful text enhancement without risking data breaches.
- **Flexibility:** Supports customization with parameters like faker_seed, prompt_template, and temperature.
- **Scalability:** Stateless architecture ensures seamless scalability for large datasets.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Enables detailed monitoring for auditability.

Use these inputs to experiment with the Privacy Shield Tool and observe how Anonymization and Reverse Anonymization work in action.

### Example # 1
John Doe submitted an application for a bank loan. His Social Security Number is 123-45-6789. If you need to contact him, call 555-123-4567 or email him at [john.doe@example.com.](john.doe@example.com)

### Example # 2
Emily Johnson recently reported a lost package. The tracking number is 1Z999AA10123456784. Please send updates to her email at [emily.johnson@companymail.com](emily.johnson@companymail.com) or call her at (987) 654-3210.

### Example # 3
Dr. Sarah Brown conducted an appointment with patient Alex Smith. The patient's phone number is 312-555-6789, and their email address is [alex.smith@example.com.](alex.smith@example.com)

### Example # 4
Mark Anthony purchased a ticket for the flight scheduled on 12/25/2024. His passport number is A1234567, and he can be contacted via email at [mark.anthony@gmail.com](mark.anthony@gmail.com) or phone at +1-234-567-8901.

### Example # 5
David Clark placed an order on 11/10/2024 with the credit card number 4111 1111 1111 1111. For queries, contact him at [david.clark@shoppingmail.com](david.clark@shoppingmail.com) or call 555-987-6543.

## Getting Started
### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the Privacy Shield repository and navigate to the project directory:

```py
git clone https://github.com/senthilsweb/privacyshield.git
cd privacyshield
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment
**Step 1:** Create and Activate Virtual Environment
