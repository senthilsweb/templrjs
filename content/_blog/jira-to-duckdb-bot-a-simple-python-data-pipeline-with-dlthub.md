## Use Case

Organizations often use JIRA for project management, and the need to automate data extraction from JIRA for analytics is common. The approach was to create a lightweight bot that automates the extraction of JIRA issue data using a JQL query, processes it in CSV format, and loads it into databases like DuckDB for development purposes or Snowflake for production-level analytics. This provides a streamlined and efficient solution for integrating JIRA data into an analytics pipeline.

This article serves as the foundation for a series of new articles focused on engineering metrics, covering how to collect, analyze, and visualize data to gain actionable insights enabling deeper reporting and better decision-making for engineering projects.

## Design

Built as a bot using the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), ensuring the process is modular and contained in a single Python file. Here’s a breakdown:

::list{type="success"}
- **Environment Variables (.env):** Key configurations like JIRA credentials, JQL queries, and the database sink are stored in environment variables, making it easy to switch between different environments without changing the code.
- **Swappable Sinks:** With DLThub, switching between development (DuckDB) and production databases (Snowflake) is seamless—just modify the configuration file and install the required packages.
- **Lightweight & Embeddable:** The bot is small and efficient, designed to avoid bulky dependencies, and runs in any environment (Jupyter Notebook or as a standalone Python script).
- **Structured Logging:** Using structlog, the bot logs all activities, making monitoring and debugging simple and effective.
::

## Technology Stack

::list{type="success"}
- **DLT (Data Load Tool):** Powers the pipeline, handling data extraction and loading.
- **DuckDB/Motherduck:** Provides a fast, lightweight SQL database for development and small data lakes.
- **Python:** The language driving the automation and orchestration.

## Prerequisites

::list{type="success"}
- Python Virtual Environment
- JIRA API Token and Username
::

## Source Code

::list{type="success"}
1. <a href="http://duckdb.py/" class="dark:text-teal-400 relative transition hover:text-teal-500 dark:hover:text-teal-400">bot_jira_to_duckdb.py</a> 

    [https://gist.github.com/senthilsweb/1e1caa0c9d95b3772c36d3a210caab11]

2. .env
```JIRA
JIRA_BASE_URL="https://yourdomain.atlassian.net/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-csv-all-fields/temp/SearchRequest.csv"
JIRA_JQL='project = "GTMS" ORDER BY created ASC'
JIRA_AUTH_TOKEN="your_auth_token"
JIRA_USER_NAME="your_jira_email"
DLT_PIPELINE_NAME=templrjs #Duckdb filename
DLT_DESTINATION=duckdb # database type i.e. duckdb | motherduck | postgres
DLT_DATASET_NAME=pmo #schema name
DLT_TABLE_NAME=jira_issues # table name
```

3. .dlt/secrets.toml (Optional as this example code doesn't require it)
```JIRA
[destination.motherduck.credentials]
database = "your_db"
password = "your_motherduck_token"

[destination.postgres.credentials]
database = "postgres"
username = "your_username"
password = "password" # replace with your password
host = "localhost" # or the IP address location of your database
port = 5432
connect_timeout = 15
```

### Execute the Code to See the Results
```JIRA
python ./bot_jira_to_duckdb.py
```

Once you execute the script, it will create a DuckDB database file named temprjs.duckdb in the root.
